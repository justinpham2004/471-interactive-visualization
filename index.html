            <h1>College Admissions Analysis</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>Introduction to the Dataset</h2>
                <p>This analysis explores the socioeconomic factors influencing college admissions in the United States
                    using a comprehensive dataset. The dataset includes detailed information about admissions, parental
                    income, attendance rates, and institutional characteristics across different types of colleges.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The analysis is motivated by findings from Chetty, Deming, and Friedman (2023), which highlight
                    significant disparities in admissions at highly selective private colleges. The study suggests that
                    children from high-income families have a considerable advantage in gaining admission to these
                    institutions, often due to legacy preferences, non-academic ratings, and athlete recruitment.
                    Understanding these disparities is crucial to exploring potential policy changes that could increase
                    socioeconomic diversity among students and, by extension, among future leaders.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Chosen Variables and Categories</h2>
                <p>For this analysis, the dataset is divided into three key categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>X and Y Variables:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>par_income_bin</code>: Categorical representation of parental income levels.</li>
                            <li><code>attend</code>: Attendance rates across different income groups.</li>
                            <li><code>attend_level</code>: Attendance levels normalized by income bins.</li>
                            <li><code>attend_sat</code>: Attendance rates segmented by SAT scores.</li>
                            <li><code>rel_apply</code>: Relative application rates by income levels.</li>
                            <li><code>rel_attend</code>: Relative attendance rates by income levels.</li>
                            <li><code>rel_att_cond_app</code>: Relative attendance conditional on application.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>School Type Category:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Highly Selective Private</li>
                            <li>Other Elite Schools (Public and Private)</li>
                            <li>Selective Public</li>
                            <li>Highly Selective Public</li>
                            <li>Selective Private</li>
                            <li>Ivy Plus</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The primary objective is to examine how income-based disparities manifest across different types of
                    institutions, focusing on the influence of parental income on attendance, application rates, and
                    conditional attendance rates. By analyzing these variables across the defined school types, we aim
                    to identify patterns and potential leverage points for policy interventions aimed at increasing
                    socioeconomic diversity in higher education.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Design Choice for Webpage</h2>
                <p>We designed our webpage with a split-panel layout, positioning the interactive visualization on the
                    left and the explanatory content on the right. This approach allows users to engage with the
                    visualization while simultaneously reading about the dataset and insights, creating a more intuitive
                    and interactive experience. To enhance usability, we made the right panel scrollable, ensuring users
                    can easily navigate through the analysis without losing sight of the data visualization. This
                    prevents the need for excessive scrolling up and down, which could disrupt the exploratory process.
                </p>
                <p>From a design standpoint, the parallel structure of the visualization and write-up offers a cleaner
                    and more cohesive user experience compared to a top-down layout. Additionally, we opted for a soft
                    cream-colored background to reduce eye strain and provide a visually pleasing interface. Our team is
                    satisfied with the final design, particularly the scrollable right panel, as it effectively balances
                    interactivity and readability.</p>
            </section>



            <section>
                <h1>Rationale for Design Decisions and Implemented Interactions</h1>

                <h3>1. Dropdown Menus for Exploration</h3>
                <p>To make the visualization interactive, dropdown menus allow users to customize what they see:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>X and Y Variable Selection:</strong> Users can choose different factors to compare, such
                        as parental income, attendance rates, or application rates.</li>
                    <li><strong>School Category Selection:</strong> Users can filter the data by institution type (e.g.,
                        Ivy League, public universities, highly selective private schools).</li>
                    <li><strong>Highlight a Specific School:</strong> Users can select a school from a dynamically
                        updated list to emphasize it in the visualization.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Dynamic Scatterplot with Bubble Sizes</h3>
                <p>Each bubble represents a college or university:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bubble Position:</strong> Determined by the selected X and Y variables (e.g., parental
                        income vs. attendance rate).</li>
                    <li><strong>Bubble Size:</strong> Represents data magnitude, larger bubbles indicate greater values
                        based on the selected metric.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bubble Color:</strong> Differentiates institutions, making it easier to distinguish them
                        visually.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Highlighting a Selected School</h3>
                <p>When a user selects a school from the dropdown, its corresponding bubble in the scatterplot is
                    outlined in black, making it stand out. This ensures users can easily locate a particular school
                    while still seeing it in the broader context.</p>

                <h3>4. Tooltips for On-Demand Information</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scatterplot Tooltip:</strong> When a user hovers over a bubble, a tooltip appears,
                        displaying the university name and its classification (private, public, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Bar Chart Tooltip:</strong> When a user hovers over a bar, a tooltip appears, showing
                        the university name, income level, and relative attendance, regardless of the selected X and Y
                        variables.</li>
                </ul>



                <h2>Why These Choices Over Others?</h2>

                <h3>1. Simplicity and Clarity Over Complexity</h3>
                <p>Initially, brushing and linking (allowing users to filter data by clicking on points in the
                    scatterplot) were considered. However, this would have added unnecessary complexity for users
                    unfamiliar with advanced data visualization techniques. The current design maintains flexibility and
                    control without making the interface difficult to use.</p>

                <h3>2. Avoiding Information Overload</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A legend was considered but was removed due to space constraints. Instead, each school is
                        uniquely colored, and tooltips provide additional details.</li>
                    <li>A gradient color scale for parental income was considered, but it made comparisons harder. A
                        categorical color scale (with distinct colors for each institution) was chosen instead.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Balancing Detail with Interactivity</h3>
                <p>Rather than showing all possible information at once, the visualization lets users explore at their
                    own pace:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dropdowns provide control over what data is displayed.</li>
                    <li>Tooltips reveal additional details only when needed.</li>
                    <li>Highlighting draws attention to a selected school without cluttering the chart.</li>
                    <li>The bar chart provides a more detailed breakdown for specific schools.</li>
                </ul>
