            <h1>College Admissions Analysis</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Introduction to the Dataset</h2>
                <p>This analysis explores the socioeconomic factors influencing college admissions in the United States
                    using a comprehensive dataset of 1,946 entries and 81 variables. The dataset includes detailed
                    information about admissions, parental income, attendance rates, and institutional characteristics
                    across different types of colleges.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The analysis is motivated by findings from Chetty, Deming, and Friedman (2023), which highlight
                    significant disparities in admissions at highly selective private colleges. The study suggests that
                    children from high-income families have a considerable advantage in gaining admission to these
                    institutions, often due to legacy preferences, non-academic ratings, and athlete recruitment.
                    Understanding these disparities is crucial to exploring potential policy changes that could increase
                    socioeconomic diversity among students and, by extension, among future leaders.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Chosen Variables and Categories</h2>
                <p>For this analysis, the dataset is divided into three key categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>X and Y Variables:</strong> These variables focus on income levels and related
                        admissions metrics:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>par_income_bin</code>: Categorical representation of parental income levels.</li>
                            <li><code>attend</code>: Attendance rates across different income groups.</li>
                            <li><code>attend_level</code>: Attendance levels normalized by income bins.</li>
                            <li><code>attend_sat</code>: Attendance rates segmented by SAT scores.</li>
                            <li><code>rel_apply</code>: Relative application rates by income levels.</li>
                            <li><code>rel_attend</code>: Relative attendance rates by income levels.</li>
                            <li><code>rel_att_cond_app</code>: Relative attendance conditional on application.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>School Type Category:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Highly Selective Private</li>
                            <li>Other Elite Schools (Public and Private)</li>
                            <li>Selective Public</li>
                            <li>Highly Selective Public</li>
                            <li>Selective Private</li>
                            <li>Ivy Plus</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The primary objective is to examine how income-based disparities manifest across different types of
                    institutions, focusing on the influence of parental income on attendance, application rates, and
                    conditional attendance rates. By analyzing these variables across the defined school types, we aim
                    to identify patterns and potential leverage points for policy interventions aimed at increasing
                    socioeconomic diversity in higher education.</p>
            </section>
            <section> <h2> Design Choice for Webpage</h2>
                <p>We chose to split the visualization and the write-up on our webpage into a left and right panel. We made this choice so the viewer could interact simultaneously with the visualization (on the left) and the description (on the right). As you can see, we made the right panel scrollable so the viewer could seamlessly scan through information about the dataset while tinkering with the data visualization and observing patterns based on it. We felt this was a more intriguing method of capturing the reader’s attention rather than having the reader scroll down constantly to understand the data and scroll up to play with the interactive visualization. From a design perspective, the left and right panels look more coherent rather than having the write-up below the visualization. After all, this makes the webpage “interactive”. As a bonus, we changed the general background to a cream color to make it pleasant for the viewers’ eyes. As a team, we felt content with the final design choice for the webpage, especially the scrollable option for the right panel of information.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Rationale for Design Decisions</h2>
                <h3>Visual Encodings</h3>
                <p><strong>Color:</strong> D3’s categorical color scale is used to differentiate institutions. This
                    choice helps distinguish categories without overwhelming users.</p>
                <p><strong>Size:</strong> Bubble size represents the <code>attend</code> variable, highlighting
                    attendance disparities across institutions.</p>
                <h3>Interaction Techniques</h3>
                <p><strong>Dynamic Filters:</strong> Allow switching X, Y, and School Type variables for a dynamic experience for users. Users can utilize these choices to further explore and interact with the visualization. 
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Dynamic Filter/Brush and Linking:</strong> Our group decided to implement a mix of dynamic queries and Brushing and linking into our visualization. Since we wanted to provide users the ability to take a closer look at certain schools and portions of data, but we understood it may be difficult to precisely select schools by "brushing" over portions of the dataset, we elected to allow users to "select" specific schools to analyze. This would be represented by having a dynamically changing 2nd bar chart that would showcase a specific schools information. When hovering over a point of data in this vis, users can see a more details into each data bar. Furthermore, when a school is selected, this school is highlighted in the first visualization as well for clarity reasons.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Tooltips:</strong> Provide on-demand information about institutions to prevent visual
                    clutter. The information showcased depends on the visualization selected.</p>
