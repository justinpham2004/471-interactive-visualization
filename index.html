            <h1>College Admissions Analysis</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Introduction to the Dataset</h2>
                <p>This analysis explores the socioeconomic factors influencing college admissions in the United States
                    using a comprehensive dataset of 1,946 entries and 81 variables. The dataset includes detailed
                    information about admissions, parental income, attendance rates, and institutional characteristics
                    across different types of colleges.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The analysis is motivated by findings from Chetty, Deming, and Friedman (2023), which highlight
                    significant disparities in admissions at highly selective private colleges. The study suggests that
                    children from high-income families have a considerable advantage in gaining admission to these
                    institutions, often due to legacy preferences, non-academic ratings, and athlete recruitment.
                    Understanding these disparities is crucial to exploring potential policy changes that could increase
                    socioeconomic diversity among students and, by extension, among future leaders.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Chosen Variables and Categories</h2>
                <p>For this analysis, the dataset is divided into three key categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>X and Y Variables:</strong> These variables focus on income levels and related
                        admissions metrics:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>par_income_bin</code>: Categorical representation of parental income levels.</li>
                            <li><code>attend</code>: Attendance rates across different income groups.</li>
                            <li><code>attend_level</code>: Attendance levels normalized by income bins.</li>
                            <li><code>attend_sat</code>: Attendance rates segmented by SAT scores.</li>
                            <li><code>rel_apply</code>: Relative application rates by income levels.</li>
                            <li><code>rel_attend</code>: Relative attendance rates by income levels.</li>
                            <li><code>rel_att_cond_app</code>: Relative attendance conditional on application.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>School Type Category:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Highly Selective Private</li>
                            <li>Other Elite Schools (Public and Private)</li>
                            <li>Selective Public</li>
                            <li>Highly Selective Public</li>
                            <li>Selective Private</li>
                            <li>Ivy Plus</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The primary objective is to examine how income-based disparities manifest across different types of
                    institutions, focusing on the influence of parental income on attendance, application rates, and
                    conditional attendance rates. By analyzing these variables across the defined school types, we aim
                    to identify patterns and potential leverage points for policy interventions aimed at increasing
                    socioeconomic diversity in higher education.</p>

                <h2>Rationale for Design Decisions</h2>
                <h3>Visual Encodings</h3>
                <p><strong>Color:</strong> D3’s categorical color scale is used to differentiate institutions. This
                    choice helps distinguish categories without overwhelming users.</p>
                <p><strong>Size:</strong> Bubble size represents the <code>attend</code> variable, highlighting
                    attendance disparities across institutions.</p>
                <h3>Interaction Techniques</h3>
                <p><strong>Dropdown Menus:</strong> Allow switching X, Y, and School Type variables for flexibility in
                    exploration.</p>

                <p><strong>Tooltips:</strong> Provide on-demand information about institutions to prevent visual
                    clutter.</p>
                <h3>Alternatives Considered</h3>
                <p>Brushing and linking were considered but deemed too complex. A legend was also considered but omitted
                    due to space constraints.</p>
